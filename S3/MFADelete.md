To use MFA delete we must enable versioning on the bucket.

# You will need MFa to
- permanently delete an object version.
- suspend versioning of the object


# Rule
- Only the bucket owner can enable/disbale MFA-Delete

# Limitation (By the time I've published it)
- Can only be enabled using the CLI
