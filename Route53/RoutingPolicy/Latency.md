It follows the principle of [User -Distance B/W- AWS REGION] and returns the IP which will have lowest latency.

When u will create a record with multiple IPs and Routing policy as Latency AWS console will show you multiple record with the same name but at the end it is one.

It returns only 1 IP back to browser on DNS lookup.
